The basic element of tracker music can be called a pattern.
A pattern is a table defining the order and mode of playback of samples (instruments)
The pattern is a table defining the order in which the samples (instruments) are played on several channels in a certain period of time.
In the program, it is represented by the main element - the "canvas" in which the music is written.

-----

Notes takes the form 'KKOIIFPP', where:

    KK = Key (One of 'C-', 'C#', 'D-', 'D#', 'E-', 'F-', 'F#',
                     'G-', 'G#', 'A-', 'A#', 'B-', or '--').
    O  = Octave (0 to 6, or '-').
    II = Instrument or macro index (Decimal, 01 to 99, or '--').
    F  = Effect Command (Hexadecimal, 0 to F, or '-').
    PP = Effect Parameter (Hexadecimal, 00 to FF, or '--').

A composition is a sequence of patterns.
You can specify it with the " + " buttons below the patterns themselves.
When you click on the " + " a modal window is displayed with the choice of the desired pattern or
button " - " to cancel the selected pattern.

-----

Music can't just be played out of thin air, you need instruments to play it.
In the program, you can see the entire list of available instruments in the corresponding part of the window.
Only 10 instruments are available to the user as standard, but if you select a third-party song
or by loading ".wav" files in a special way in the folder "sample", additional  instruments can become available to the user.

-----

The special instrument download image is to rename ".wav"
according to the following cipher "nn|name|******.wav", where:

    nn = Instrument number (01 to 99)
    name = Instrument name (any characters except "|", ".")
    ****** = Two three-digit numbers or asterisks (numbers can be -nn or --n, for example -12--4)

There are 2 buttons for playing music: 
    
    1 (left) - plays the current pattern
    2 (right-top) - plays the whole song according to the specified pattern sequence
